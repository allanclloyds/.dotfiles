# 5l's .dotfiles

These are my various dotfiles, maybe they will come in handy for someone.

## Vim

Most Vim plugins are installed via git submodules/pathogen, see:
  http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/

Plugins not under version control with git, ie. most anything found on
vim.org, I just copy directly to ~/.vim for simplicity, provided that they
only consist of a plugin file and a helpfile.

Anything more complicated I'll install via Vimball or create its own
directory under ~/.vim/bundle

Vimballs are _somewhat_ justifiably hated, but they do in fact have an
uninstall mechanism:

    :RmVimball <vimballname>

See http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502 for more details.

My ~/.vim/.VimballRecord is under version control, so anything here
installed via a vimball can be removed with :RmVimball from Vim, otherwise
it should be no more complicated than removing the specific file in
~/.vim/plugin or the directory/submodule under ~/.vim/bundle

There are some projects to assist with installing/uninstalling plugins
that you might want to check out:

- vim-addon-manager:
  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2905
- update_bundles:
  http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen

If you only want to checkout the ~/.vim directory you can use git sparse
checkouts like so:

    git clone https://github.com/5l/.dotfiles.git
    cd .dotfiles
    git config core.sparsecheckout true
    echo .vim/ > .git/info/sparse-checkout
    git read-tree -m -u HEAD
